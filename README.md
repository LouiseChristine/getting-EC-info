I have extracted json files for certain features offered by NSX-V, vCenter and VCD platforms. By these scripts, I'm simply arranging them into a single CSV file, for readability.
Still, there's manual work, like rechecking, aligning, and deleting the tags entirely.
It's enough for now though.
The ideal way would be to convert them into Terraform and rebuild easily on the new NSX-T, vCenter and VCD platform we're building.
